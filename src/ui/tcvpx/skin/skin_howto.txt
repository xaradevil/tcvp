position     The position of the title, relative to the upper left

	     recognized by X or rgb values on the form "rgb:30/30/a0"
	     Alpha is between 0 and 255. No alpha means 255.

	     be scrolled. The possible values for this parameter are:
	     1  - Do not scroll
	     2  - Ordinary scrolling
	     4  - Scroll back and forward in a pingpong way
	     No scroll_style parameter means "Do not scroll".

	font "arial:pixelsize=10"
	color "NavyBlue" 42
